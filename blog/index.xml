      <description>If you are interested in the correctness of your Web API, you should consider building a strongly typed integration between the client and the server.
Just the usual In most cases, defining an API and using it can be quite prone to errors.
Every Scala HTTP library has its own approach in building and defining endpoints, requests and responses which can become tedious in maintaining.
Morever, there&amp;rsquo;s no support to properly document the APIs, this means that the documentation is manually defined which will eventually lead to integration errors.</description>

      <description>This might not be one of your daily problems. Evaluating polynomials seems to be a simple task until the coefficients become big numbers, e.g. 1024 bits or more, and could impact your whole software component.
Classic evaluation A simple way to evaluate a polynomial is:
def classicCompute(variable: BigInt): BigInt = { coefficients .zipWithIndex .foldLeft(BigInt(0)) { case (accumulator, (coefficient, i)) =&amp;gt; accumulator + coefficient * variable.pow(i) } }  Optimized evaluation In order to optimize a polynomial evaluation, one could use Horner&amp;rsquo;s method, which implies a significant improvement when using big numbers.</description>
